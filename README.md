# Magic the gathering booster pack generator

This app was made mostly to learn/practice react hooks. it is a mtg booster pack generator meant to be used with Tabletop Simulator.

## things to note:

- i could not make a card be "foil" in TTS so i replaced the foil chance for a promo chance, with a slightly lower chance of appearing.

- When viewing the cards in the set showcase you can click double sided cards to see the other side of the card

- The default number of booster packs generated is 12, if you want to change this you can do so with the drop-down on the top right but you need to do it before clicking "Get packs"

- the tokens use a different card back to tell them apart from normal cards easily, so when you load the packs you will see only the token card back on top of all the packs instead of the normal MTG card back because the token is on the back of the pack

- if you hold your mouse over a single card in game you will see the price of the card according to scryfall ( at the moment the packs were generated )

## how to use it:

1. Pick the amount of boosters you want, or leave it at 12 which is the default

2. pick the set you wish to draft

3. click get packs

4. click download

5. save the file to you TTS saved objects folder

6. load up in TTS and enjoy!
